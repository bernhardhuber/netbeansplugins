Hi Bernhard,
     sorry it took so long to answer, but we are quite busy and the
queue with module is quite long.

Although I like the idea behind your modules (especially the keytool
module), I am afraid I have to reject your modules in their current
state. I will be glad to publish them if the following problems are fixed:
1. Both modules do not have a license - there has to be license in the
NBM that will be shown the the user. Sorry, but we cannot publish
modules without license. You can use for example SPL or
http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
2. There are some quite big problems in the keytool module:
a) If the keystore cannot be opened because of incorrect password (an
exception "Keystore was tampered with, or password was incorrect"), no
dialog is shown to the user (tested on NB5.0 final). I think that some
nice dialog explaining that the password was probably incorrect is
necessary.
b) I did not find a way to provide an empty password while
creating/opening a keystore.

I see also a few problems, which I would like to see solved, but which
are not blockers from my point of view:
1. (continuing problem 2a)): Also not opening the KeyStore Window when
an incorrect password was entered might be a good idea (it cannot show
anything usefull anyway). Idealy allow the user to retype the password.
2. The enablement logic of "Next" button in the New Keystore dialog is
quite strange: when the IDE starts, open this dialog, go to /tmp and
write "test" on the keyboard: the "Next" button is disabled. Press Enter
and the "Next" button is magically enabled. I do understand that this is
because the dialog incorporates the JFileChooser, but it feels really
strange.

Thanks for your support,
     Jan
